"""Differential-drive forward kinematics for the Husarion RosBot.

The 4-wheel RosBot is treated as a differential drive: the two left
wheels share one angular velocity, the two right wheels share another.
This is an approximation -- skid-steer slip means the achieved (v, omega)
will not exactly match the commanded (v, omega), especially during
in-place rotation. That residual is handled later in the localization
layer; this module only solves the geometric mapping.

Frame convention: body x forward, y left, z up; positive omega yaws
left (about +z). Units are SI throughout: v in m/s, omega in rad/s,
wheel angular velocities in rad/s.
